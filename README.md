Are recent layoffs from Meta and other tech companies adversely affecting the production of artificial intelligence research?

# Introduction
The tech industry has seen an upwards trend of layoffs in recent years, with many companies downsizing their workforce or cutting jobs to stay both competitive and reduce costs. At the same time, the production of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models has also been on the rise, seeing many tech companies heavily investing in AI research and development.

In this blog post, we will explore the possible relationship between the layoffs in tech and the production of AI models as well as attempt to understand the factors that may be driving this relationship. We will also present a plot generated using Python that illustrates the increasing trend of layoffs in 2022.
